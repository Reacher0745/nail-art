Unveiling the Artistry of Russian Manicure
Russian manicure is a technique that originated in Russia and has gained popularity worldwide for its precision and attention to detail. Unlike traditional manicures, which focus primarily on grooming the nails and cuticles, Russian manicure involves a series of specialized tools and techniques to achieve flawless results. At Code Hair Ladies Salon, our technicians are experts in the art of Russian manicure, ensuring that your nails are not only beautifully groomed but also healthy and strong.

The Russian Manicure Process
Preparation: The nail technician will start by gently removing any existing nail polish and shaping the nails to your desired length and shape.

Cuticle Care: Using specialized tools, the technician will carefully push back and remove excess cuticle growth, ensuring a clean and polished look.

Exfoliation: A gentle exfoliating scrub is applied to the hands and nails to remove dead skin cells and reveal smoother, healthier-looking skin.

Hydration: Moisturizing products are applied to the hands and nails to replenish moisture and nourish the skin.

Nail Strengthening: To strengthen the nails and promote growth, a strengthening treatment may be applied, depending on your individual needs.

Polishing: Finally, your nails are polished to perfection using high-quality nail polish or gel polish in the color or design of your choice.
